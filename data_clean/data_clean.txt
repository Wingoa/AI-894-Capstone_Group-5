DATA CLEANING & FIGHTER VECTORS
================================


WHAT IT DOES
------------
Transforms raw UFC fight stats into fighter vectors ready for training.
Creates 15 normalized metrics per fighter
Aggregates each fighter's career stats using two methods: SMA and EMA 



RUN PIPELINE
------------
cd data_clean/
python run_data_clean.py

This runs 3 steps:
  1. Clean raw stats & add outcomes (process_data.py)
  2. Create fighter vectors & aggregations (fighter_vectors.py)
  3. Validate output quality (analyze_fighter_vectors.py)



FILE DIFFERENCES
----------------
training_data.csv (clean_data/)
  - NOT aggregated - normalized per-minute stats
  - Used as INPUT to create fighter vectors

fighter_vectors_sma_train.csv / fighter_vectors_sma_test.csv (fighter_vectors/)
  - Aggregated fighter stats using Simple Moving Average (10-fight rolling window)

fighter_vectors_ema_train.csv / fighter_vectors_ema_test.csv (fighter_vectors/)
  - Aggregated fighter stats using Exponential Moving Average (span=10, decays over career)


OUTPUTS FOR TRAINING
--------------------
Use these files to train:

fighter_vectors_sma_train.csv + fighter_vectors_sma_test.csv
  - Target: outcome (1=win, 0=loss)
  - Use for: Recent form-based models (last 10 fights matter most)

fighter_vectors_ema_train.csv + fighter_vectors_ema_test.csv
  - Target: outcome (1=win, 0=loss)
  - Use for: Long-term style-based models (career trends with recent emphasis)

Train both SMA and EMA models, compare AUC to see which generalizes better.
