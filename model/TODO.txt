NEXT STEPS FOR MODEL TRAINING

1. Create matchup_features.py
   - Load train_set.csv and test_set.csv
   - Compute fighter differentials (A - B) for all 14 features
   - Example: striking_pace_diff, takedown_accuracy_diff, control_pct_diff
   - Save as train_matchup.csv and test_matchup.csv

2. Train NMF style model
   - Use 25 style features from features.py
   - Extract 5 components (striking, muay thai, wrestling, grappling, pace)
   - Save model + fighter style profiles

3. Train XGBoost classifier
   - Use 14 matchup differential features
   - Target: outcome (win/loss)
   - Goal: ≥68% precision, AUC ≥ 0.72

4. Add SHAP explainability
   - Identify top 5 outcome drivers per prediction
   - Build "what-if" optimizer for tactical recommendations
